metMirror
=========
Met Mirror is an interactive installation prototype that encourages Metropolitan Museum visitors and staff to "see themselves" in the Met's collection. Using the open-source programming environment Processing, Met Mirror programmatically replaces the pixels from a video camera with like-colored images culled from the Met's archive of art and design objects. 

This prototype could easily be augmented with an automated feed of images, say from the Met's website, to create customized installations for exhibitions, special events and educational programs.

NB: Inspired and built off of the talented [Andy Sigler's] (https://github.com/andySigler) Street Fighter sketch.
